		<h3>The 90’s Are Over - Tech Recruiters Haven’t Evolved</h3> 

<p>Do you ever get nostalgic for the nineteen eighties and nineties? 
Going to the library whenever you needed to look up something, going to the travel agent whenever you needed to fly home to visit your parents for Christmas, or maybe just hitting the local video rental place.  If you ever want to journey back to those bygone days, we know how you can simulate part of that experience, become a developer and hand your resume to a recruiter, or become a hiring manager and post a job opening.  The times have changed, the technologies have changed, but barely technically literate tech recruiters haven't.  They may pitch you offers by sending five emails a day now instead of five faxes, but their offers are just as vague, inaccurate, and inappropriate as ever.  And the developers' annoyance pales when it comes to the poor hiring managers who ultimately get forwarded 200 badly matched candidates, and spend an average of 30-60 days trying to fill any given position, enlisting the poor project managers and developers within that company, pulling them away from their work to help sort through these applications.  Time and money is lost to a system rife with inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and waste.Tech Recruiting 

<h3>System is Badly Broken</h3>

<p>So why is the system so broken? 
 It may start with an HR person tasked with creating a job description for a position involving technologies they don’t understand.  This job description then gets passed to or discovered by a tech recruiter who knows the tech only slightly deeper than the buzzwords.  That recruiter may then cast a wide net, hitting resume, job, and business profile sites which are not granular enough to capture a developer’s true and up to date tech tree and which has done nothing to insist that the picture the developer has painted of himself or herself is an honest and accurate one.  As the old developer adage goes: garbage in, garbage out.</p>


<h3>$15k Spent Per Developer Placed through Tech Recruiting - Bad Matches</h3>
<p>
But this approach persists.  Recruiters get on average $15k for every developer placed.  Without the right knowledge and tools, tech recruiters rely on persistence and luck, making hundreds of nearly blind emails and phone calls just to find a single candidate.  And they repeat that process as many times as necessary until they get one of their candidates placed.  And as far as the recruiters are concerned, their system works.  It may barely work for the companies desperate for high quality developers, it may barely work for the developers being placed, but technical recruiting agencies have little motivation to recognize and correct these massive problems.

Disruption is Overdue - Devs Vetting Devs and Being Recruiters
</h3>
<p>
But we know there's a better way, and a disruptive change is overdue.  It's time for the developers who live every day deep in these technologies to act as peer filters, vetting and connecting hiring managers to the potentially hired.
</p>
<h3>
Developers Are Best Judge of Developers - Developers Help Developers
</h3>
 <p>
Developers evaluate other developers every day.  Every line of code a colleague checks in, the the architecture of every open source library they use, developers know how to evaluate code, and the developer behind it.  Developers are the right people for this virtual recruitment job.  And developers prove the passion they have for their community and fellow developers every day.  They devote countless hours sharing their knowledge on sites like StackExchange, as well as sharing their sharing code with open source projects on sites like Github.

<h3>
Referral.io is Developer-Built Microtasking Platform
</h3>
<p>
We are developers building the tools and microtasking platform that will let these member developers take much needed control of this employment pipeline.  

Here's how it works...  When a hiring manager posts a job listing through our site our member developers immediately begin to provide any necessary feedback, similar to when one asks a question on StackExchange or Quora.  If the job listing left out some critical detail, if it included conflicting or inaccurate information, the community will ensure the listing is updated.  Our developers will ensure the listings that come into the system are the kind that can truly be matched with high quality candidates.  And other member developers will then begin to act as the new tech recruiters finding within our highly granular, developer-focused database the very best candidates, matching the real skills needed with the proven skills they possess, ensuring the fit.  And before each candidate gets passed to the hiring managers, their appropriateness has been further confirmed by others, until a threshold of consensus is reached.
</p>

<h3>
Developers Vetting/Testing Other Developers 
</h3>
<p>
And unlike sites such as LinkedIn where more than half the profiles contain lies big and small, our database of developers is not a free-for-all, encouraging people to mix fiction and fact and enlist others in upvoting non-existent skills.  The most important activity of our member developers is the continual vetting of new entrants as well as the new information of old members.  If you claim to be a JavaScript expert, you'll have to prove it before it becomes a matchable part of your profile.  We'll create a combination of tools to help developers vet other developers, everything from timed, monitored skills quizzes, to live peer interviews, to examination of your social coding profiles, and more.  This combined with our blind matching and interview system will encourage fits based solely on the a developer’s skills, reducing the impact of persistent and problematic subtle human biases related to things such as gender, age, and ethnicity.
</p>

<h3>
Developer Motivation to Help
</h3>
<p>
And why will our member developers spend all this time vetting their peers, and being vetted by their peers?  As we've said developers have a rich history of giving back and being involved, when there are the tools that make the jobs manageable, they also take great pride in their coding creds, the reputation points they've earned across various collaborative sites.  And we’ll capitalize on this, and let them see how they truly compare to their peers, both in skills and the compensation they receive for those skills.  We’ll help them understand how they can grow their careers and their salaries.  But we'll also offer them cash for their contributions.  Whether it's helping to clean up job listings, reviewing their peers, or helping to ultimately place a candidate they'll be rewarded in proportion to their efforts.  And we'll keep our members honest, or at least keep our dishonest ones quiet.  Your activity builds your reputation, and your reputation changes your ability to impact across the site and your ultimate rewards.

<h3>
Codefolios - Best Candidates May Not Be Job Searching - 75% of Devs Interested in New Opportunites 
</h3>
<p>
And the value of these profiles, these “codefolios” which capture the achievements of their coding life, is not just for those actively seeking employment.  The best, brightest, and most suitable candidates are often already employed, just not in positions that are ultimately best for them, most are restless, under utilized.   Over 75% of all developers are actively looking for a new job or are open to considering new opportunities.   With those developers' data in our system, those better opportunities, specifically matching their real skills and passion can still find them.

Opportunity Huge - US Spends $72B/year - 15% of Tech Hires through Recruiters
</h3>

<p>
“US corporations spend nearly $72 billion each year on a variety of recruiting services, staff, and products – and the worldwide number is likely three times bigger.”  “The recruitment industry grew by 9.7% last year” alone.  And tech recruiting accounts for 15% of new developer hires.  Companies desperately want a better solution, developers desperately want a better solution, we have that solution.
